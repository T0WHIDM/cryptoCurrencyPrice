📚 About The Project

Crypto Currency Price is a Flutter-based practice application designed to demonstrate structured software development using Clean Architecture and real-world API integration.

This project focuses on applying scalable architectural patterns and best practices to build a maintainable and testable mobile application.

🎯 Objectives

Integrating with external RESTful APIs

Implementing Clean Architecture (Presentation, Domain, Data layers)

Applying SOLID principles

Managing state efficiently

Writing modular and reusable code

Improving separation of concerns

Structuring a project for long-term scalability

🏗 Architectural Overview

The project follows Clean Architecture principles:

Presentation Layer
Handles UI and state management.

Domain Layer
Contains business logic, entities, and use cases.

Data Layer
Manages API calls, models, and repository implementations.

This layered approach ensures:

Better testability

Clear responsibility boundaries

Easier feature expansion

Improved maintainability

🚀 Purpose

This application was built as a structured learning exercise to simulate real-world development scenarios and reinforce architectural best practices in Flutter development.

It is not intended for production use, but rather as a technical showcase of clean code principles and API-driven application design.
